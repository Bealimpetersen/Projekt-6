          <h2>Why choose QuadSAT?</h2><br>
          <p>QuadSAT adds a new dimension to antenna diagnostics. The compact
          system is transported directly to the antenna and autonomously flies
          in a pre-planned pattern, resulting in a high quality, operationally
          flexible, and time-saving solution. QuadSAT’s unique solution enables
          a range of on-site measurements such as antenna radiation patterns
          and antenna alignment. The payload mounted on the drone enables
          maximal location flexibility. As a mobile test-facility, it can
          operate anywhere in the world on antennas of all sizes.
          <br><br>
          Customers have different needs. In QuadSAT we work with you to ensure that you

          <p>
            QuadSAT´s unique solution is an airborne antenna and tracking test
            system. With the QuadSAT system, antennas can be tested anytime and
            anywhere. The system can perform a broad range of testing missions
            to suit your needs, whether out in the field for operational
            antennas or in the testing phase for new antennas.QuadSAT's system
            turns a drone into a flying antenna diagnostics system. The system
            is easy to use and portable enabling it to be used where needed.
            With a QuadSAT system, tests are performed where and when needed
            reducing operational expenditure

          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>
            <br><b>Pre-testing:</b>
            QuadSAT’s technician arrives directly on site of the antenna.
            Mission characteristics as antenna size and frequency are entered
            in QuadSAT’s custom pre-flight software prior to testing.
            <br><br><br><b>Test:</b>
            Based on QuadSAT’s pre-flight software, the drone-based test range
            lifts off and automatically performs the antenna measurements. The
            tested antenna remains in it’s ordinary operation. The automation
            provided in QuadSAT’s solution ensures repeatable and accurate
            results with every flight.
            <br><br><br><b>Post testing:</b>
            QuadSAT’s post-flight software delivers a detailed report based on
            customer requirements. All tests results are delivered in the same
            uniform data format that ensures comparability of test-data and
            makes it possible to follow an antennas performance over time.

          <h2>The software</h2>
          <p>
            The system includes custom pre- and post-flight software for
            automated flight and antenna diagnostics. QuadSAT software
            automatically generates a report on test results. 2D and 3D diagrams
            for patterns for cuts and raster scans combined with raw data
            <br><br> <b>How it works:</b>
            <br>- Drone-based system transmits CW test signal to antenna under test
            (AUT) which is in Rx mode
            <br>- AUT receive and transmit patterns are generated using reciprocity
            principle
            <br>- Signal received by antenna is measured with spectrum analyser and
            power meter connected to the ground control station
            <br>- RTK base station provides increased accuracy of drone GPS position
            (3 cm)
            <br>- The flight of the drone is planned and automated from the ground
            control station
            <br>- QuadSAT’s unique solution enables a range of on-site measurements
            e.g. antenna radiation patterns and antenna alignment. The payload
            mounted on the drone enables maximal location flexibility. As a
            mobile test-facility, it can operate anywhere in the world on
            antennas of all sizes.
